//  Represents a swift file with structs that conform to the View
//      protocols that allow the views code

//  This is where we can find the necessary View elements that are used to interact with
//  This file needs to be referenced as a property in ContentView that holds the navigationstack
//  Each view element will have a reference to a NavigationLink and the View elements/structs needed
